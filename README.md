# 2012-long-island-longshore-transport
This project investigates wave height and longshore sand transport during Hurricane Sandy in relation to typical wave height and longshore sand transport during the year 2012. The analysis focuses on wave height and direction data to estimate sediment transport rates using a simple formula for longshore sand transport. Standard meteorological data for 2012 were downloaded from the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) Station 44065, located at the New York Harbor entrance off the coast of Long Island's South Shore. Work completed for EES 3330 at Vanderbilt University.
